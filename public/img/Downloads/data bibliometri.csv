This lack of interpretability is significantly limiting the adoption of such models in domains where decisions are critical such as the medical and legal fields. Recently, researchers have been interested in developing methods that help explain individual decisions and decipher the hidden representations of machine learning models in general and deep networks specifically. While there has been a recent explosion of work on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (ExAI) on deep models that operate on imagery and tabular data, textual datasets present new challenges to the ExAI community. Such challenges can be attributed to the lack of input structure in textual data, the use of word embeddings that add to the opacity of the models and the difficulty of the visualization of the inner workings of deep models when they are trained on textual data.",,,,,,,,

It is the task of automatic generation of correct and relevant questions from textual data. Despite its usefulness, manually creating sizeable, meaningful and relevant questions is a time-consuming and challenging task for teachers. In this paper, we present an NLP-based system for automatic MCQG for Computer-Based Testing Examination (CBTE).We used NLP technique to extract keywords that are important words in a given lesson material. To validate that the system is not perverse, five lesson materials were used to check the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The manually extracted keywords by the teacher were compared to the auto-generated keywords and the result shows that the system was capable of extracting keywords from lesson materials in setting examinable questions. This outcome is presented in a user-friendly interface for easy accessibility.",,,,,,,,

The record of the National Safety Council reported that drowsy driving is caused by 9.5% of all crashes (100,000 cases). Therefore, preventing and minimizing driver fatigue is a significant research area. This study aims to design a nonintrusive real-time drowsiness system based on image processing and fuzzy logic techniques. It is an enhanced approach for Viola–Jones to examine different visual signs to detect the driver's drowsiness level. It extracted eye blink duration and mouth features to detect driver drowsiness based on the desired facial feature image in a specific driver video frame. The size and orientation of the captured features were tracked and handled for determining image features such as brightness, shadows, and clearness. Lastly, the fuzzy control system provides different alert sounds based on the tracked information from the face, eyes, and mouth in separate cases, such as race, wearing glasses or not, gender, and various illumination backgrounds. The experiments’ results show that the proposed approach achieved high accuracy of 94.5% in detecting driver status compared with other studies. Also, the fuzzy logic controller efficiently issued the required alert signal of the drowsy driver status that helps to save the driver's life.",,,,,,,,

Chatbot helps in responding to a message quickly and that too without human intervention. Startups are inventing thousands of chatbots in order to provide a better service and keep their customers busy by a kind and simple conversation. It also helps in providing far better services to customers and helps in buying products. It takes an input from the user in the form of keywords, and it matches those keywords in its data-set to give out the corresponding output saved in it. It gives all the possible answers related to user queries. Since, most of the times like during pandemic, we cannot go outside and cannot meet people, it is an interactive way to get to know about how world is dealing with it. Chatbots exploits AI and ML platforms. Chatbots are becoming popular day by day in this modern era, they are being used in business groups and helps in reducing costs and can help in providing one to many communications that means it can handle multiple customers at same time. Chatbots need to be as efficient as possible.",,,,,,,,

Then, by inputting the subject matter of the case into the system, the system’s accuracy, recall rate, and error rate and other related indicators are evaluated, to analyze the performance of the legal retrieval system. The results show that in the case analysis of a single theme, the accuracy rate of the case with the theme of “impeding police enforcement” is low, and the accuracy rate of the other theme cases is over 70%, and the highest accuracy rate even reaches 95%. In the case retrieval analysis of multitheme, the accuracy rate of case retrieval is improved, higher than 75%, and the zero-detection rate is significantly reduced with the increase in keywords. In the analysis of network case retrieval, the average correct rate of the overall case retrieval will be nearly 65%. Further tests on its reliability show that during the continuous week of the retrieval test, the system has no faults and passed the reliability test. Therefore, through this study, it is found that the application of NLP technology in the legal AI retrieval system has a reliable accuracy, which meets the expectation of this paper.",,,,,,,,

Hence, several researches have been conducted to develop automatic text classification for national and international languages. However, the need for an automatic text categorization system for local languages is felt. The main aim of this study is to establish a Pashto automatic text classification system. In order to pursue this work, we built a Pashto corpus which is a collection of Pashto documents due to the unavailability of public datasets of Pashto text documents. Besides, this study compares several models containing both statistical and neural network machine learning techniques including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), decision tree, gaussian naïve Bayes, multinomial naïve Bayes, random forest, and logistic regression to discover the most effective approach. Moreover, this investigation evaluates two different feature extraction methods including unigram, and Time Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (IFIDF). Subsequently, this research obtained average testing accuracy rate 94% using MLP classification algorithm and TFIDF feature extraction method in this context.",,,,,,,,

This paper describes a possible way to set up an indexing scheme that offers a smart search modality, that combines semantic analysis of video/audio transcripts with the exact time positioning of uttered words. The proposal leverages NLP methods for topic modeling with lexical analysis of lessons’ transcripts and builds a semantic hierarchical index into the corpus of lessons analyzed. Moreover, using abstracting summarization, the system can offer short summaries on the subject semantically implied by the search carried out.",,,,,,,,

Some plant varieties are particularly subject to outbreaks of diseases; on the other hand, some are opposite to them. Huge numbers of diseases are seen on the plant leaves and stems. Diseases management is a challenging task. Generally, diseases are seen on the leaves or stems of the plant. Image processing is the best way for the detection of plant leaf diseases. Different kinds of diseases occur because of the attack of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The monitoring of leaf area is an important tool in studying physiological capabilities associated with plant boom. Plant disorder is usually an unusual growth or dysfunction of a plant. Sometimes diseases damage the leaves of plants.",,,,,,,,

Ethical dilemmas in nursing settings are wide-ranging. When HCRs are introduced to long-term facilities and hospitals for patient communication, new kinds of ethical dilemmas may arise. Using interviews with healthcare providers, I examined the potential ethical dilemmas concerning the development and introduction of HCRs that may interact with older adults. This analysis was based on four primary issues from the nurses’ perspective. Since HCRs will be used in healthcare settings, it is important to protect patient rights and maintain their safety. To this end, discussion and collaboration with an interdisciplinary team is crucial to the process of developing these robots for use among patients.",,,,,,,,

1,,Embedding from Language Models (ELMos)- based Dependency Parser for Indonesian Language,2021,International Journal of Advances in Soft Computing and its Applications,Alzaytoonah University of Jordan,http://dx.doi.org/10.15849/ijasca.211128.01,,753,5/14/2024 20:15,journal-article,10.15849/ijasca.211128.01,2710-1274,,13,3,2,11,1,0.33,0,0,3,"The goal of dependency parsing is to seek a functional relationship among words. For instance, it tells the subject-object relation in a sentence. Parsing the Indonesian language requires information about the morphology of a word. Indonesian grammar relies heavily on affixation to combine root words with affixes to form another word. Thus, morphology information should be incorporated. Fortunately, it can be encoded implicitly by word representation. Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) is a word representation which be able to capture morphology information. Unlike most widely used word representations such as word2vec or Global Vectors (GloVe), ELMo utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over characters. With it, the affixation process could ideally encoded in a word representation. We did an analysis using nearest neighbor words and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) word visualization to compare word2vec and ELMo. Our result showed that ELMo representation is richer in encoding the morphology information than it's counterpart. We trained our parser using word2vec and ELMo. To no surprise, the parser which uses ELMo gets a higher accuracy than word2vec. We obtain Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) at 83.08 for ELMo and 81.35 for word2vec. Hence, we confirmed that morphology information is necessary, especially in a morphologically rich language like Indonesian. Keywords: ELMo, Dependency Parser, Natural Language Processing, word2vec",,,,,,,,

Since non-technical users write their software requirements themselves and in unrestricted natural language, deficits occur such as inaccuracy and incompleteness. These deficits are usually met by natural language processing methods, which have to face special challenges in OTF Computing because maximum automation is the goal. In this paper, we present current automatic approaches for solving inaccuracies and incompletenesses in natural language requirement descriptions and elaborate open challenges. In particular, we will discuss the necessity of domain-specific resources and show why, despite far-reaching automation, an intelligent and guided integration of end users into the compensation process is required. In this context, we present our idea of a chat bot that integrates users into the compensation process depending on the given circumstances.",,,,,,,,

The application contains three components: the team management system, the search system, and the chat system. Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges, such as ensuring user privacy. Comparative analysis with three alternative solutions demonstrated several notable advantages, including an intuitive and user-friendly interface, granting students full autonomy over their clubs, and being open to all students from diverse club interests. This innovative application has the potential to empower students, foster collaboration, and provide a valuable resource for educational institutions and students alike [2]",,,,,,,,

We perform this study using the case of a conversational assistant, built using the RASA framework. The automatic assistants for answering text queries are built in different languages and code mixing of languages, while doing so, experimentation with different components in an NLU pipeline is conducted. Sparse and dense feature extraction accomplishes the language agnostic composite featurization of text in the pipeline. We perform experiments with intent classification and entity extraction as part of information extraction. The efficacy of the language agnostic NLU pipeline is showcased when (i) dedicated language models are not available for all languages of our interest, and (ii) in case of code mixing. Our experiments delivered accuracies in intent classification of 98.49%, 96.41% and 97.98% for same queries in English, Hindi and Malayalam languages, respectively, without any dedicated language models.",,,,,,,,

Employing a data set of 70 countries, the present study considers the role of market forces and bilateral and multi-lateral pressures on implementation of soft law. There is little known about the role of legal system structure-related variables as factors moderating the implementation of multi-lateral agreements and international soft law, such as the 1988 accord. The present study extends upon research within the extant literature by employing a novel estimation method, a neural network modelling technique, with multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MPANN). Consistent with earlier studies, the article identifies a significant and positive effect associated with democratic systems and the implementation of the Basle accord. However, extending upon traditional estimation techniques, the study identifies the significance of savings rates and government effectiveness in determining implementation. Notably, the method is able to achieve a superior goodness of fit and predictive accuracy in determining implementation.",,,,,,,,

Timely solutions are achieved using local premises rather than supporting centralized servers or clouds. Computing within the network partly occurs near the physical endpoints, and this is where the edge computing paradigm comes in to help. The proposed method of the cloud optimization suggests splitting and sharing data between network data centers and local computing power. Provision of distinct paths between edge and main cloud for each smart device is achieved using separate blockchain which register and store the logical links of hierarchical data. Methods for cryptographic key splitting between the edge and the main cloud, as well as strong authentication ensuring the shared data confidentiality, integrity, availability, and consistency are also given.",,,,,,,,

Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can contribute to fighting terrorism by predicting in real-time future terrorist attacks if accurate data is available. This paper is part of a research project that uses text from social networks to extract necessary information to build an adequate dataset for terrorist attack prediction. We collected a set of 3000 social network texts about terrorism in Burkina Faso and used a subset to experiment with existing NLP solutions. The experiment reveals that existing solutions have poor accuracy for location recognition, which our solution resolves.

It forced people to profoundly review their relationships and interactions with digital technologies. Nevertheless, people prefer using these technologies in their favorite languages. Unfortunately, most languages are considered even as low or less-resourced, and they do not have the potential to keep up with the new needs. Therefore, this study explores how this kind of languages, mainly the Amazigh, will behave in the wholly digital environment, and what to expect for new trends. Contrary to last decades, the research gap of low and less-resourced languages is continually reducing. Nonetheless, the literature review exploration unveils the need for innovative research to review their informatization roadmap, while rethinking, in a valuable way, people’s behaviors in this increasingly changing environment. Through this work, we will try first to introduce the technology access challenges, and explain how natural language processing contributes to their overcoming. Then, we will give an overview of existing studies and research related to under and less-resourced languages’ informatization, with an emphasis on the Amazigh language. After, based on these studies and the agile revolution, a new roadmap will be presented.",,,,,,,,

The recurrent neural network serves as a fundamental component for numerous techniques in domain of NLP. The present article conducts a comprehensive evaluation of various algorithms for processing textual and voice data, accompanied by illustrative instances of their functionality. Various algorithmic outcomes exhibit the advancements achieved in this field during the preceding decade. Our endeavor involved the classification of algorithms based on their respective types and expounding on the scope for future research in this domain. Furthermore, the study elucidates the potential applications of these heterogeneous algorithms and also evaluates the disparities among them through an analysis of the findings. Despite the fact that natural language processing has not yet achieved its ultimate objective of flawlessness, it is plausible that with sufficient exertion, the field will eventually attain it.

The implemented algorithm version allosws for the association of a set of words into clusters. After finding the centre of every cluster — the most relevant word, all the others are aggregated according to a defined metric adapted to the language processing realm. All the relevant stored information (necessary to answer the questions) is processed, as well as the questions, by the algorithm. The correct processing of the text enables the chatbot to produce answers that relate to the posed queries. Since we have in view a chatbot to help elder people with medication, to validate the method, we use the package insert of a drug as the available information and formulate associated questions. Errors in medication intake among elderly people are very common. One of the main causes for this is their loss of ability to retain information. The high amount of medicine intake required by the advanced age is another limiting factor. Thence, the design of an interactive aid system, preferably using natural language, to help the older population with medication is in demand. A chatbot based on a subtractive cluster algorithm is the chosen solution.",,,,,,,,

But one should ask why so much data is being collected. Part of the answer is simple in light of scientific projects, but why is there so much data on us? Then, we ask about its “interface” through fog computing. Such questions prompt this article on the philosophy of big data and fog computing. After some background on definitions, origins and contemporary applications, the main discussion begins with thinking about modern data collection, management, and applications from a complexity standpoint. Big data is turned into knowledge, but knowledge is extrapolated from the past and used to manage the future. Yet it is questionable whether humans have the capacity to manage contemporary technological and social complexity evidenced by our world in crisis and possibly on the brink of extinction. Such calls for a new way of studying societies from a scientific point of view. We are at the center of the observation from which big data emerge and are manipulated, the overall human project being not only to create an artificial brain with an attendant mind, but a society that might be able to survive what “natural” humans cannot.",,,,,,,,

Among the many open and unexplored questions in this field is the following: “Which activities can minds perform during their lifetime?” This question is very broad, thus our contribution here addresses the sub-question “Which non-boring activities can minds perform?” This issue is ethically relevant for human minds if the predicted significant extension of our lifetime materializes and we are then potentially challenged how to spend this additional time. The space of potential non-boring activities has been called “fun space.” We analyze the relation between various types of minds and the portion of the fun space, which is accessible for them.

The “necessity of a large amount of data” is and will become an even more significant problem. Obtaining an accurate solution from small amounts of data requires imagination and the detection of trends from a small number of phenomena. One approach is to add artificial data. For example, data can be created by intentionally including noise, and the variation may be expanded by a crossover. Different data can be generated by association or inference. Needless to say, these are artificial data and are not correct cases. “Humanistic AI” must be implemented by devising a scheme to allow accurate learning from small amounts of data. I think that the days when robots are considered enemies are transient and robots will soon be recognized as good partners that support humans instead of being rivals.",,,,,,,,

This data is collected through satellite imagery, aerial photography, and surveying instruments such as total stations and GPS receivers. The applications of geodetic data processing are diverse and include land surveying, mapping, navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. It is crucial to understand and manage the Earth’s resources and address global challenges such as climate change, natural disasters, and urbanization. In recent years, the information technology industry has undergone a considerable transformation that has significantly impacted the development of various disciplines. Intelligent systems, powerful tools for understanding and solving complex engineering issues, have become increasingly important in this context. Soft computing techniques, including artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and evolutionary algorithms, are used more frequently in geodetic data processing due to their ability to handle complex, imprecise, and uncertain data. This study discusses using soft computing techniques in geodetic data processing and examines the challenges and future directions in using soft computing techniques in geodetic data processing.",,,,,,,,

The author has been engaged in constructing and analyzing emotion corpora in some domains based on different sources. From the analysis results, emotion expressions started to become more understood that they have differences and tendencies according to the attributes of the writers and the speakers. In this chapter, I focused on the differences detected in the attributes of the writer/speaker with respect to language patterns; in usage tendencies or combinations of words, unknown expressions (slangs), sentence patterns, non-verbal expressions (emoji, emoticon, etc.) with relevant emotions, then introduce the outcome of the analytical survey on a large scale corpus obtained from a social networking service.",,,,,,,,

However, relatively little attention has been paid in numerals found in texts and many systems treated the numbers found in the document in ad-hoc ways, such as regarded them as mere strings in the same way as words, normalized them to zeros, or simply ignored them. Recent growth of natural language processing (NLP) research areas has change this situations and more and more attentions have been paid to the numeracy in documents. In this survey, we provide a quick overview of the history and recent advances of the research of mining such relations between numerals and words found in text data.",,,,,,,,

The web services composition comes to address the satisfaction of new and complex needs such as the process we find in most organizations. Its purpose is to perform several services to meet user demand. The satisfaction of a user needs a dynamic and reusable environment to meet those needs. In this context, the user interactions are essential. From there, in this work, we define two objectives: i) propose a service composition approach that allows dynamic services composition and its purpose is to meet a need. ii) Propose a personalization approach for Web services composition which allows the reuse of services while adopting for the context of each user. Our approach is based on the use of ontologies and user profile.",,,,,,,,

I present the results of an experiment in which test subjects were asked to read short dialogues containing either presupposition triggers or conversational implicatures and, next, answer the questions regarding the information communicated on the level of presupposition or implicatures, respectively. The results of within-subject ANOVA show that presuppositions activated by the use of implicative verbs are significantly less accessible and illicit significantly longer response times than presuppositions activated by the use of hard triggers, suggesting that they can be classified as soft presupposition triggers. The obtained results also show that presuppositions activated by the use of different triggers are heterogenous in regards to the accessibility of information.",,,,,,,,

These spam emails may cause serious threat to the user i.e., the email addresses used for any online registrations may be collected by the malignant third parties (spammers) and they expose the genuine user to various kinds of attacks. Another method of spamming is by creating a temporary email register and receive emails that can be terminated after some certain amount of time. This method is well suited for misusing those temporary email addresses for sending free spam emails without revealing the spammers real account details. These attacks create major problems like theft of user credentials, lack of storage, etc. Hence it is essential to introduce an efficient detection mechanism through feature extraction and classification for detecting spam emails and temporary email addresses. This can be accomplished through a novel Natural Language Processing based Random Forest (NLP-RF) approach. With the help of our proposed approach, the spam emails are reduced and this method improves the accuracy of spam email filtering, since the use of NLP makes the system to detect the natural languages spoken by people and the Random Forest approach uses multiple decision trees and uses a random node for filtering the spams.",,,,,,,,

Image captioning is a task that combines both computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) domains. However, existing studies in the English language primarily focus on visual features to generate captions, resulting in a gap between visual and textual features and inadequate semantic representation. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybridized attention-based deep neural network (DNN) model. The model consists of an Inception-v3 convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder to extract image features, a visual attention mechanism to capture significant features, and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) with attention decoder to generate the image captions. The model was trained on the Flickr8k and BNATURE datasets with English captions, which were translated into Amharic Language with the help of Google Translator and Amharic Language experts. The evaluation of the model showed improvement in its performance, with a 1G-BLEU score of 60.6, a 2G-BLEU score of 50.1, a 3G-BLEU score of 43.7, and a 4G-BLEU score of 38.8. Generally, this study highlights the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in generating Amharic Language image captions with better semantic meaning.",,,,,,,,

Hoax has seven classifications. Classification problems such as hoax classification can be automated using the application of the Deep Learning model. Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network (Bi-TCN) is a type of Deep Learning architectural model that is very suitable for text classification cases. Because the architecture uses dilation factors in its feature extraction so it can generate exceptionally large receptive fields and is supported by Bidirectional aggregation to ensure that the model can learn long-term dependencies without storing duplicate context information. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of Bi-TCN architecture combined with pre-trained FastText embedding model for hoax classification in Indonesian and implement the resulting model on website. Based on the research that has been done, the model with Bi-TCN architecture has satisfactory performance with an accuracy score of 92.98% and a loss value that can be reduced to 0.191. Out of a total of 13,673 data tested with this model, only 414 data or in other words around 3% of the total data were incorrect predictions.",,,,,,,,

The study uses code-switching as a test to argue for the multilingual capabilities of each model and compares and studies their cross-lingual understanding. All models were tested using 84 prompts (N = 252), with their responses subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis. This study compares the naturalness of the outputs, code-switching competence (CSness), and the frequency of hallucinations. Results of pairwise comparisons show statistically significant differences in naturalness and the ability to produce grammatical code- switched output across models. This study underscores the critical role of linguistic representation in large language models (LLMs) and the necessity for improvement in handling LRLs.",,,,,,,,

It holds paramount importance for various communities, as it allows individuals with hearing difficulties to communicate effectively. In sign languages, there are numerous signs, each characterized by differences in hand shapes, hand positions, motions, facial expressions, and body parts used to convey specific meanings. The complexity of visual sign language recognition poses a significant challenge in the computer vision research area. This study presents an Arabic Sign Language recognition (ArSL) system that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and several transfer learning models to automatically and accurately identify Arabic Sign Language characters. The dataset used for this study comprises 54,049 images of ArSL letters. The results of this research indicate that InceptionV3 outperformed other pretrained models, achieving a remarkable 100% accuracy score and a 0.00 loss score without overfitting. These impressive performance measures highlight the distinct capabilities of InceptionV3 in recognizing Arabic characters and underscore its robustness against overfitting. This enhances its potential for future research in the field of Arabic Sign Language recognition.",,,,,,,,
